# Classification of wines using classification techniques
This project involves classifying the wines. Classifying the wine is an important task in the field of wine prediction based on attributes. Through this project, we aim to explore whether preprocessing is needed or not to classify the wines
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the wine dataset.it contains various chemical properties of wines such as Alcohol, Malic Acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium a soon. It also contains the class label with class-1, class-2, class-3 with 178 instances with no missing values.
# Orange tool:
1.The orange tool in data mining classification problems likely refers to Orange an opensource data visualization and analysis tool. Orange provides a visual programming interface for data mining, allowing users to interactively explore, analyze, and visualize data, particularly for tasks like classification, regression, clustering.

2.Orange offers a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface where users can build data analysis workflows by connecting various components called "widgets." It provides a range of visualization tools to explore datasets, including scatter plots, bar charts, box plots, histograms, and more.

# Project Overview
The notebook provides an overview of the steps involved in classification of wine using classification techniques. The steps include:

1.Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a file (orange tool)

2.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

3.Applying Algorithms like KNN, Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks, Decision tree

4.Model Evaluation: Accessing the model performance using test and score such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score

5.Prediction: Using the trained model to make classification prediction on new wines

Finally, by observing the above table we an conclude that no preprocessing techniques are required and support vector machine gives high accuracy is found out of by comparing each algorithm
